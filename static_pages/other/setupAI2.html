  <h1>App Inventor 2: The Fastest Way to Build an Android App</h1>
  <p>It usually takes a few hours to set up any app development environment. Even App Inventor Classic had some "getting started" issues! With App Inventor 2, things are dramatically different. <em>if you have a WiFi connection, a computer and a phone, you can get setup within minutes.</em></p>
  <h3>The 2 Minute Solution</h3>
  <p>The following steps will work for most people whether you are at home or office/school. If you are at a school/office with restrictions on WiFi access, check-out the troubleshooting link below. 
  <ul>
    <li>You need not download anything to your computer</li>
    <li>On your phone or tablet, open the Google Play Store and find and install the MIT AI2 Companion app. INSTALLING FROM THE PLAYSTORE
     IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED so you'll get automatic updates.  The Companion app is just an Android App that lets you test the apps you build as you're building them. Install it on your phone and start it up.</li>
      <li>Back in your computer's browser (Chrome, Firefox or Safari), open app inventor by going to <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu">ai2.appinventor.mit.edu.</a> Create a new project.</li>
   <li> In the top menu, click on 'Connect' and 'Connect to Companion'. A QR code will appear. Scan this QR code with the MIT AI2 Companion. You should see your app.</li>
   </ul>
  <h3>Troubleshooting </h3>
  <p>Though the WiFi connection is the fastest and easiest way to use App Inventor 2, the tool does provide alternatives including connecting your phone to the computer
   with a USB cable and using an emulator. For help with either of these, please see the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup.html">setup instructions</a> on the MIT App Inventor site.

<h3>All Setup? It's Tutorial Time</h3>
<p>Try the <a href="/IHaveADream-steps">"I Have a Dream" app</a> or the tutorials on <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html">the MIT site</a>
